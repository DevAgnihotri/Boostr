### 🧠 Prompt for Claude

> **Prompt Title:** Design a Luxury Landing Page for BOOSTR
>

>
> ---
>
> ### 🏷️ Brand Overview
>
> **Name:** BOOSTR
> **Tagline:** “For the Few Who Create More.”
> **Audience:** Elite creators — photographers, designers, musicians, and creative entrepreneurs who view their art as high-value.
> **Goal:** Make creators *apply to join*. The “Apply as a Creator” CTA leads to login/signup.
> **Aesthetic:** Minimalist luxury with a red, black, and white palette. Sharp contrast. Spacious. High-end typography.
> **Mood:** Power, exclusivity, artistry, ambition.
> **Tone:** Sophisticated, confident, aspirational.
>
> ---
>
> ### 🎨 Design Direction
> * Overall layout should feel **cinematic and story-driven**, not a modular SaaS page.
> * Each scroll section should *reveal* BOOSTR’s world — use luxury brand pacing and rhythm.
> * Use **motion subtly** (fade-ins, parallax, slow zoom) to build drama.
> * Hero section: full-bleed visuals, powerful tagline centered, with a small “Apply as a Creator” button below.
> * Typography: bold sans-serif headlines, thin-serif body text (mix of power and grace).
> * Visual elements: abstract gradients in red/black, glass reflections, or monochrome imagery of creators.
> * Keep content minimal but impactful — like how luxury brands use fewer words, more emotion.

> ### 🧩 Section Flow (example)
>
> 1. **Hero:**
>    “For the Few Who Create More.”
>    → background video or motion image of creators at work (in studio, stage, design lab).
>    → CTA: “Apply as a Creator.”
>
> 2. **Philosophy:**
>    A single sentence on-screen at a time.
>    “Not everyone gets to create. Not everyone gets to be seen. BOOSTR is where art earns its power.”
>
> 3. **Creators in Focus:**
>    Showcase 3–4 sample creators as “portraits of ambition.” Minimal descriptions, clean grid with black-and-white images and red accent hover effect.
>
> 4. **The Experience:**
>    Explain BOOSTR’s difference — exclusive access, better funding terms, private community. Minimal copy, elegant visuals.
>
> 5. **Join Section:**
>    “You don’t apply to fit in. You apply to stand out.”
>    → “Apply as a Creator” button.
>
> 6. **Footer:**
>    Small, centered logo. No clutter. Just socials, copyright, and a whisper of luxury.
>

>
> ---

> Every pixel should breathe exclusivity and ambition.
